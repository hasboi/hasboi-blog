        <p>
            You ever catch yourself doing something small--something theirs--and realize you've forgotten where they end
            and you begin?
        </p>

        <p>
            Like yesterday, when I rinsed my mouth twice without thinking. Just like she taught me. We haven't spoken in
            years. Haven't touched in longer.
        </p>

        <p>
            But there she was--in the way I tilted my head at the mirror, in the exact rhythm of my spit hitting
            porcelain. Muscle memory written in someone else's handwriting.
        </p>

        <p>So that's when I realized: </p>

        <p>
            I'm not one person. I'm a scrapbook. <br />
            A living museum of every "I love you" that ever took root in me.
        </p>

        <p>
            --I still chew straws with my teeth, just like my high school crush. She kisses someone else now. My teeth
            remembers. <br />
            --I hum when I'm scared, same off-key tune Mom used to sing washing dishes. I used to think it was annoying.
            But now it's mine.
            <br />
            --I cut sandwiches diagonally because a boy with skinned knees once swore triangles tasted better. He was
            right. I still eat like we're twelve. And he's married now.
        </p>

        <p>
            The way I stretch out "duuuude" like taffy--that's not me.
            <br>
            That's the ghost of a boy from sophomore who
            promised we'd be friends
            forever before moving to Canada and forgetting my name.
            <br>
            His voice lives in my throat now.
        </p>

        <p>
            Funny, how love lingers like a phantom limb.
        </p>

        <p>
            Not just the epic romances. The tiny intimacies: <br>
            The "text me when you're safe" that stopped getting replies. <br>
            The "we should do this again" that never happened. <br>
            The sunsets shared through train windows, gold and temporary, already fading as you tried to memorize them.
            <br>
        </p>

        <p>
            They never really leave. They just sink deeper. <br>
            Become part of your foundation. <br>
            Become part of your architecture. <br>
        </p>

        <p>
            You think you've outgrown them until--
            <br>
            --a song, a scent, a stupid inside joke--
            <br>
            and suddenly you're a Matryoshka doll of ghosts,
            <br>
            each nested inside the other,
            <br>
            still whispering.
        </p>

        <p>
            Love doesn't vanish.
            <br>
            It migrates.
            <br>
            From their hands to yours,
            <br>
            from their mouth to your memory,
            <br>
            from their heartbeat to your bones.
        </p>

        <p>
            So go ahead.
            <br>
            Miss them.
            <br>
            Keep them.
            <br>
            Let them live in the way you stir your tea,
            <br>
            in the nicknames you can't retire,
            <br>
            in the quiet moments when you swear you can still hear them
            laughing.
        </p>

        <p>
            Because the people who matter never really leave.
            <br>
            They just learn how to live inside you.
        </p>
